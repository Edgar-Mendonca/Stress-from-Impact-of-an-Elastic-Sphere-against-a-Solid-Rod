# Stress from Impact of an Elastic Sphere against a Solid Rod
Deformation kinematics during impact of a ball on a bar. This application provides solution for Hertzian contact theory for impact of a solid sphere against a solid bar. The solution is provided following nonlinear differential equation governs the stress pulse created in the bar. The code is written in MATLAB. The user interface was developed using MATLAB's App Designer interface.
