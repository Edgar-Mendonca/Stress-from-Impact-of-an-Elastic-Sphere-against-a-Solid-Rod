# Stress from Impact of an Elastic Sphere against a Solid Rod
Deformation kinematics during the impact of a ball on a bar. This application provides a solution for Hertzian contact theory for the impact of a solid sphere against a solid bar. The solution is provided following a nonlinear differential equation governs the stress pulse created in the bar. The code is written in MATLAB. The user interface was developed using MATLAB's App Designer interface.
