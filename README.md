# Stress from Impact of an Elastic Sphere against a Solid Rod
Deformation kinematics during the impact of a ball on a bar. This application provides a solution for Hertzian contact theory for the impact of a solid sphere against a solid bar. The solution is provided following a nonlinear differential equation governs the stress pulse created in the bar. The code is written in MATLAB. The user interface was developed using MATLAB's App Designer interface.<br/>
**Note**: Requires Symbolic Math Toolbox to Perform symbolic math computations downloadble from Matlab toolbox section.

### For Bar:
œÅ = Density (kg/m3)<br/>
R = Radius of bar (m)<br/>
C = Speed of stress wave (m/s)<br/>
E1 = Young's Modulus of bar material (N/m2)<br/>
v1 = Poissons ratio of bar material<br/>
t = Charateristic time/cycle time (s)

### For Ball:
r = radius of material (m)<br/>
E2 = Young's Modulus of ball material (N/m2)<br/>
v2 = Poissons ratio of ball material<br/>
